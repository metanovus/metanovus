## 🏆 Competition Projects  

### 🏷️ [ecom.tech x AI Learning Lab (ITMO) (Demo-version)](https://github.com/metanovus/ecom-tech-label-comp)
Competition to develop a data tagging service for training ML models. In the final received 3th place.

### 💫 [ecom.tech x Deep Learning School NLP Workshop](https://github.com/metanovus/ecom-tech-nlp-comp)
Ranked in the **top 5** (4th place) for multi-label classification of user feedback into 50 categories using 🤗 [ruRoberta-large](https://huggingface.co/ai-forever/ruRoberta-large).  

### 🤖 [Nornickel Hackaton](https://github.com/metanovus/nornikel-rag-2024)
Ranked in the pre-final for development of a pipeline for a multimodal RAG system as part of the Nornickel hackathon using 🤗 [colpali-v1.2](https://huggingface.co/vidore/colpali-v1.2) and 🤗 [Vikhr-2-VL-2b](https://huggingface.co/Vikhrmodels/Vikhr-2-VL-2b-Instruct-experimental).

### 📜 [IT Purple Hack 2025](https://github.com/metanovus/it-purple-hack-2025)
A project that made it to the semi-finals by solving five competitive cases. I have developed a smart assistant for home interior design and built a program for placing virtual machines.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Personal Projects

### 🎭 [MoodMeter - Telegram Chat Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/metanovus/MoodMeter)  
A team project to classify user sentiments using 🤗 [ruBERT](https://huggingface.co/blanchefort/rubert-base-cased-sentiment-rurewiews). My role included backend integration (Heroku, database setup), script development, and deploying the final product. **Winner of the competition’s final round.**

### 🧑‍💻 [BuenoJob - Smart Job Search](https://github.com/metanovus/bueno-job)
My personal ongoing project on smart job search using Sentence-BERT pre-trained model and Qdrant.

### 💬 [RAG Smart Courses Adviser](https://github.com/metanovus/rag-courses-advicer)
RAG chatbot project that parses information using bs4, processes using 🤗 [DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased-sentence](https://huggingface.co/DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased-sentence) and 🤗 [cointegrated/rubert-base-cased-nli-threeway](https://huggingface.co/cointegrated/rubert-base-cased-nli-threeway) and uses Mistral AI via API.

### 📚 [Small Personal Projects](https://github.com/metanovus/my-projects)
- Car fault classification with boosting algorithms (LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost).  
- Bird detection with YOLOv3.  
- Semantic segmentation for autonomous vehicles using U-Net.  

🕹️ **Fun Fact:**  

As a hobby, I developed a globally top-8 mod, [Wind of Time](https://ap-pro.ru/stuff/zov_pripjati/veter-vremeni-r201/), for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. This involved enhancing the game engine (**C++**), scripting logic (**Lua**), and designing levels (SDK), sharpening my problem-solving and system design skills. The modification was developed over approximately two years.
